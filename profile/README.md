## Welcome to Amber Community's GitHub pages

This is where we store code associated with [Amber Community](https://ambercommunity.org.au/) projects.

For non-coding managers who need to understand what happens here, a good intro guide is [Intro to GitHub for non-technical roles](https://ben.balter.com/2023/03/02/github-for-non-technical-roles/).

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
